# Language-Detection-Model-ML and NLP
As we know, human language is astoundingly complex and diverse. We express ourselves in infinite ways, both verbally and in writing. Not only are there hundreds of languages and dialects, but within each language is a unique set of grammar and syntax rules, terms and slang. Natural language processing is a field of computer science, artificial intelligence, and linguistics concerned with the interactions between computers and human (natural) languages. It is important because it helps resolve ambiguity in language and adds useful numeric structure to the data for many downstream applications, such as speech recognition or text analytics. This project â€œLanguage Detection Model" is the task of determining the natural language that a document is written in. Recognizing text in a specific language comes naturally to a human reader familiar with the language. A trained linguist may be familiar with many dozens, but most of us will have, at some point, encountered written texts in languages they cannot place. Research into Language identification aims to mimic this human ability to recognize specific languages. It has a wide variety of applications.
